2. I really liked the login functionality and use of a database store a user's username, password, email, and amount of money invested. I think the process of how the money was made could be displayed to show the user which stocks were invested in

3. The Kanban board had user stories from an investor's point of view. There were only one or two more issues that needed to be done, simple tasks such as showing the app's logo. All the features added are aligned with the user stories within the Kanban board

4. The README file was lacking detailed instructions on how to install the database, but other than that it was good.

5. I really liked the overall concept of the app and the idea of letting the user being handsoff. The most impactful opportunity for improvement would be making the algorithm more transparent. I also liked the high/low risk option for investments.
